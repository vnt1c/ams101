        <h3>Course Description</h3>
        <p>This course introduces students to the fundamentals of linear algebra and includes some topics from calculus, namely the polar and parametric equations. By the end of this course, students will be able to perform basic operations on matrices, understand basic linear algebra and calculus terminology, and apply key concepts from linear algebra and calculus to solve real life problems.</p>
        <h3>Course Objectives</h3>
        <p>By the end of this course, students will:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Understand how to perform basic matrix operations, transposition, and inversion.</li>
            <li>Be able to find the determinant of 2x2 and 3x3 matrices.</li>
            <li>Learn how to solve systems of linear equations through Gaussian elimination and Gauss-Jordan elimination.</li>
            <li>Develop a good understanding of linear algebra in a geometric sense.</li>
            <li>Be able to convert between cartesian, polar, and parametric equations and integrate polar equations.</li>
        </ol>
